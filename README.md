# CodeJam13
Our goal for this hackathon was to create inventive solutions by applying the software design principles we have learned in a real-life setting. However, our main focus was on practicality and impact, which is why we opted to create a website/tool that helps students navigate a big part of their social life: the initial connections.

Chocolate chip is a website designed to help you stay connected with your contacts, or make deeper connections with acquaintances, recruiters, co-workers, etc. Our platform allows you to store vital information about your contacts, including their names, important dates, and any personalized notes you wish to add. Using this information, the website sends personalized notifications at scheduled intervals, reminding you to reach out and check up on your contacts.

The goal is to simplify and enhance your relationships by providing timely prompts to you to stay engaged and thoughtful with the people who matter to you. Through customizable reminders, you can set specific dates or recurring intervals to ensure you never miss an opportunity to connect.

Front-End: HTML, CSS, and JS Back-End: Python, Flask

Challenges: For our automated emailing reminders, we completed a python script that checks the notification queue every 5 minutes for notifications that need to be sent. It then edits an html template and sends it to the desired email address with all relevant contact information. However, we were unsuccessful in connecting the database that stores all user contacts with our notification queue in the automated emailing python script. We also ran into an issue with inputting our other field into the database so the other information is not displayed.

We are proud of the fact that we were able to complete our first project in our first hackathon. We were also very proud of ourselves each time our codes ran without any errors.

The next step for chocolate chip would be to implement this project as a mobile app, as it would not only increase the practicality of the tool but also give us another opportunity to explore a different side of coding.
